I hvae several projects in ml all related to finance except for one that classifies plants. the one that classfies plants did really well despite there being only a few pixles and multiple types of grass. 
there are several decision trees and neural networks that prdict things like churn and default from a bank. they all got really good at saving the banks money
lastly the capstone was a stock market news sentiment analyyer and weekly summerizer. this project was more impressive and the data it was trained on and backtested with is geopolitically relevent trade related news from apple in 2019
i also have a rag models i built to help analysts look at things like earnings calls and reports so that they can utilioze scaleable proggramming to get a good picture of what is going on in every thing in their portfolio despite limited time
in order to effectively do this there needs to be agentic ai solutions with multimodal llms finetuned on my favorite books and that can predict the weather and such
this will be a much more involved proccess because it is on the cutting edge of fintech
